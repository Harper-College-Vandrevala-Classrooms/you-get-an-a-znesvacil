# You Get an A! - C++ Template
Copy all the files from this repository and put them into your compiler!
You'll be adding grades in the main.cpp file.
An object called "gradebook" is made by default, but you can change the title, or add new ones simply by writing Gradebook (gradebook title); in a new line.
Inside the main() {     } bracket is where you'll be adding new material. 
To add a student, simply type (gradebook title).add_student("Student Name", "Student ID");
To add an assignment, type (gradebook title).add_assignment("Assigment Name", Total Points);
To add a grade, type (gradebook title).add_grade("Student Name", "Assignment Name", "Points Earned");
Finally, to print your gradebook, type gradebook.print();
